      <h1>A bit more about me</h1>
    </header>
    I'm Frederik, PhD Fellow at the Section for Health Data Science and AI at the University of Copenhagen. On a higher note, I am an interdisciplinary mathematical scientist interested in the intersection of probability theory and statistics with biology and public health. I hold a master's degree in statistics and a bachelor's in math, and have throughout my studies spent quite a lot of time working on mathematical models of biology and epidemiology.

    My mathematical interests are centered around how random tree structures are formed. This field contains a huge amount of interesting mathematics, from probability theory, measure theory, integral and differential equations to graph theory, geometry and topology. My main questions concern the geometry, and more generally the distribution, of trees generated by a certain class of stochastic processes called <i>branching processes</i>.

    On the biological side, my interests are naturally
