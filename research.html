    I know myself well enough that I won't end up keeping a publication list up to date, so for a full list of my scientific publications please see my <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PYxpBiMAAAAJ&hl=da">Google Scholar</a>. Instead, here you have an outline of the research areas I mostly enjoy spending time in. The general theme of my work is 

    <h2>Stochastic Trees</h2>
    If you think about a stochastic process, you would probably think about something like a random walk or maybe a Brownian motion on the reals. If you have spent some time with more advanced probability, you might think about a measure-valued process. My favorite stochastic processes however, takes values in the space of trees, specifically rooted, planar, and often ultrametric trees. There are plenty of applications of stochastic trees, but what inspires me to think about them is to track how genealogical relationships evolve over time, be these relationships between species, infectious disease carriers, or even languages.
